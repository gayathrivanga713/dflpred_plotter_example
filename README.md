DFLpred Plotter:

This script plots **DFLpred** per-residue scores along a protein sequence, calls
low-flexibility (DFL) regions using a score threshold, and (optionally) compares them to
a simple **case-based annotation** convention (lowercase letters in the input sequence
are treated as DFL by annotation).

Requirements
